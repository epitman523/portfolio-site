        <h1>Severe Weather Quiz App</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-project">
                <h2>About Project</h2>
                <p>This app is a project through Bloc and was meant to demonstrate our ability of combining all of the
                    lessons we had into a functioning web app. We were allowed to pick the topic and being from the
                    Midwest I thought that severe weather would be a relavent topic. Most people know what to do at
                    home, though. I decided that it would be more helpful and informative to do sever weather tips while
                    traveling.</p>

                <p>Since this was an assignment, there were several requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It must have a landing page with a button to start the quiz</li>
                    <li>There must be at least 5 questions that are sequential and show one at a time</li>
                    <li>Users must be able to see what question number they were on as well as their score</li>
                    <li>When the user submits their answer, they should recieve feedback on whether they're correct or
                        incorrect</li>
                    <li>There must be a overall score at the end of the quiz, as well as a way to retake the quiz</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Starting with sketches, I fleshed out the basic concept of the web app. Next I built a graybox
                    wireframe to establish the layout. From there I started building the HTML and CSS, paying close
                    attention to a11y's best web practices. Once the app was mostly built out, I began the JavaScript
                    and jQuery, which was by far the most labor intensive part of the assignment. All of the questions
                    and answers are dynamically loaded into the page. The question number and score are in the bottom of
                    the main section of the quiz and I also included a static pagination to show progress.</p>
